NYCDOE HS Graduation Rates for 2001-2005 Cohorts

This Shiny App is for searching and visulizating NYC HS Graduation Rates for children who entered 9th grade in the years between 2001 and 2005. The total number of set records is 10691 and that of theme records is 104. The dataset is from the US repository for data, data.gov. The dataset also includes measurement data for the different types of diplomas graduating students received.

To prepare this set for analysis, I added a column to differentiate between different demographic categories (eg, Race, Gender, and Learning Disabilities). The server calculations involve filtering the data for producing different output. The data is most useful when comparing individual rates for a given subset, for example "Male" and "Female."

To use the application, adjust the slider to include the years in question - between 2001 and 2005. Each year is a "cohort" that lasts 6 years. Therefore, if a student begins 9th grade in 2001 and graduates in 2005, 2006, or 2007, their graduation is counted in the graduation rate for the 2001 cohort. 

Each demographic cut (language, disability, race, gender) has its own chart below the overarching borough graduation rates. You can turn cuts "on" or "off" by checking the input box on the LHS.
